# Model Railway 3D

In the 3D-setting, two trains are added in the scene. One train is riding along a curved railway, while the other is going back and forth. Additionally, the user can control a character to walk around the scene.

## How to Start

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the packages using pip ([requirements.txt](../requirements.txt)) or conda ([environment.yml](../environment.yml)).
3. Change the directory to the 3D folder.
4. Run `python main.py` in the terminal. Add the `--full_screen` flag to enable the full screen mode with resolution 1920 x 1080.
