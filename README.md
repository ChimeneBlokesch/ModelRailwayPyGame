# Model Railway

This repository consists of two similar projects, namely creating a railroad game using PyGame. For project-specific details, please refer to the readme in the corresponding folder.

The initial idea was to create a 2D game with command-based input. The grid can be filled with tracks and trains by writing commands, such as in the format 'add straight [x1] [y1] [x2] [y2]'. After a while, I switched to a 3D-setting using OpenGL in PyGame.
