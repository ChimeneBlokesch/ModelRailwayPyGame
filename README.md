# Model Railway

This repository consists of two similar projects, namely creating a railroad game using PyGame. For project-specific details, please refer to the readme in the corresponding folder.

The initial idea was to create a 2D game with command-based input. The grid can be filled with tracks and trains by writing commands. After a while, I switched to a 3D-setting using OpenGL in PyGame.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the packages using pip ([requirements.txt](requirements.txt)) or conda ([environment.yml](environment.yml)).
3. Change the directory to the 2D or 3D folder.
4. Run `python main.py` in the terminal to start the application.
